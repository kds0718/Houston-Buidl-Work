# Houston-Buidl-Work
Open source repo for the Houston Ethereum Meetup #buidl Nights

From the 05.07.2018 buidl night. 

To run this project, ensure you have the latest version of Truffle installed. 

Clone or copy this repository to your machine. Run `npm install` to install dependancies. Next, run `truffle develop` to open the development environment and get a local testnet running. Next, run `test`, and you will be able to see how the small test we wrote at the end of the night passes when we simulate the contract migration and calls on the testnet. 

Until next time...!
